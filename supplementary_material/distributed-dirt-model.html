<h1><span class="header-section-number">Section 11</span> Distributed Dirt Model</h1>
<p>The distributed dirt model disrupts the forces underpinning division of labor by separating the performance of a mutagenic task from its mutagenic consequences. In particular, if a cell within an organism performs a mutagenic task, the performing cell accrues the resource from the task, but the cell with the least amount of mutagenic damage is probabilistically mutated and thus is assigned ``the dirt.’’</p>
<p>The other parameters within the experiment remain exactly the same as the central division of labor experiment. Cells are still able to communicate, perform tasks, tissue accrete, produce propagules, and become propagule-ineligible. Accordingly, the following downstream analyses were conducted in exactly the same way as described for the Dirty Work experiment: calculating entrenchment (Fig. <a href="distributed-dirt-model.html#fig:dd-entrench-comparison">11.1</a>), filtering revertants (Figs. <a href="distributed-dirt-model.html#fig:dd-filter-1-reevolving-multicellularity">11.2</a>), <a href="distributed-dirt-model.html#fig:dd-filter-2-failure-to-divide">11.3</a>), and plotting the distribution of fitness effects of reversion mutations (Fig. <a href="distributed-dirt-model.html#fig:dd-DFERMs">11.4</a>).</p>
<p>Using the combined datasets from the “Dirty work” treatment and the “Distributed dirt” treatment, we also examined the overall correlations between key parameters in our system that affect either entrenchment or unicellular revertant fitness (Figs. <a href="distributed-dirt-model.html#fig:Entrenchment-vs-num-revertants-rel-fitness">11.5</a>, <a href="distributed-dirt-model.html#fig:Relative-fitness-vs-uni-and-multi-growth-rates">11.6</a>).</p>
