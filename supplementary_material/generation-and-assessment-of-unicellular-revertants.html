<h1><span class="header-section-number">Section 6</span> Generation and assessment of unicellular revertants</h1>
<p>To understand the forces that govern whether or not a multicell is entrenched, we create all possible single-locus mutants at two time points: the “transitional” multicellular organism along the line of descent of the dominant multicell and “final” multicellular organism within this same lineage. For each single-locus mutant, we assess its viability as well as its fitness.</p>
<p>The first step in the assessment pipeline is the viability assay, which is a simple test to rule out organisms that are nonviable from further computationally expensive assessment. To assess a mutant’s viability, we run the mutated genome for an extended period of time (up to 10,000 updates) without mutations occurring as the result of dirty work. If, within this time period, the mutated organism is able to accumulate the resources required for reproduction and to execute the instruction to create a new organism, we consider it viable and stop the viability assay. Viable mutants are then further classified as either multicellular (indicating that it executed tissue accretion instructions resulting in cellular reproduction and thus contains more than two cells) or unicellular.</p>
<p>This viability assay is used as a gateway to further screening and thus its conclusions are refined by the subsequent growth assay. For example, since the organism is running its code in isolation it does not actually produce an offspring organism. Additionally, it may not contain propagule-eligible cells and thus may not be able to produce offspring when grown in a population under standard conditions. If so, later assays will classify it as nonviable. Similarly, the organism may be unicellular at the time of its first successful execution of the propagule production instruction and may later execute tissue accretion instructions, becoming multicellular. If so, later assays will classify it as multicellular.</p>
<div id="growth-assay-and-measuring-relative-fitness" class="section level2" number="6.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Growth assay and measuring relative fitness</h2>
<p>To measure the fitness of a multicellular progenitor strain or a unicellular revertant strain, we create a solitary organism with the genome of interest and place it into an empty population with room for 62 organisms. The organism is allowed up to 50,000 updates to reach a population size threshold of 32 organisms. Once this threshold is reached, or exceeded (multiple simultaneous reproduction events can push populations above the 32 organism threshold), we calculate the average rate of increase, or Malthusian parameter, <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, as
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\ M = log(N_f / N_i )/T
\end{equation}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(N_f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N_i\)</span> are the final and initial number of organisms in the population and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is the time it took the organism to fill the entire population. In the case that the organism fails to fill the entire population by the end of the growth assay, <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is set to the maximum allowed time of 50,000 updates.</p>
<p>To account for the effects of mutation, we repeat this process 100 times for each unicell revertant genotype and its multicell progenitor strain with different random number ``seeds,’’ leading to a different set of mutations and different cell behaviors. The fitness of a given unicell revertant relative to its multicell progenitor is defined as the ratio of their average Malthusian parameters across these replicate measurements.</p>
</div>
<div id="identification-of-unicellular-revertants" class="section level2" number="6.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Identification of unicellular revertants</h2>
<p>Some mutations that occur over the course of the growth assay could result in data that may no longer be suitable for our analyses. For example, mutations that cause an organism to re-evolve multicellularity can occur during the growth assay, confounding our ability to accurately measure the relative fitness of revertants. Another potentially confounding scenario is that the organism we initiate the population with may fail to divide in the allotted time. This can occur if the initial organism flags itself as “propagule ineligible” or if it incurs a lethal mutation, as a result of dirty work, prior to the first propagule production event. To avoid these potentially confounding effects, we employ a two-step data filtering pipeline.</p>
<p>We begin by assessing whether the organisms in the population have remained unicellular for the entire duration of the growth assay. To do this, we check that the total number of cells in the population at the end of the growth assay is not greater than the total number of organisms. In total, ~42.5% of our growth rate assays are “contaminated” with re-evolved multicells. We see considerable diversity within our unicell revertant genotypes; a single unicell genotype can produce a variety of outcomes: some which remain unicellular and others which re-evolve multicellularity. This is fully in line with our expectation that different mutations will occur in organisms started with different random seeds. While some multicellular progenitor genotypes appear to produce revertants that re-evolve multicellularity at higher rates than others, we find that the probability distributions for re-evolving multicellularity are quite similar at the transition and final time points (Fig. <a href="generation-and-assessment-of-unicellular-revertants.html#fig:dw-filter-1-reevolving-multicellularity">6.1</a>).</p>

<p>We next determine whether the organisms used to initiate the population have successfully reproduced at least once in the allotted 50,000 generations. To do this, we simply check that the total number of cells in the population is greater than 1. In total, 19% of our remaining replicate populations fail to successfully reproduce. As above, we find that some multicell progenitor genotypes are more likely than others to produce unicellular revertants that fail to successfully reproduce. However, in this case, we find that multicells from the final time point are more likely to produce inviable unicellular revertants than transition multicells (Fig. <a href="generation-and-assessment-of-unicellular-revertants.html#fig:dw-filter-2-failure-to-divide">6.2</a>).</p>
