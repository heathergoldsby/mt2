<!-- # Reversion mutation identities and the determinants of the number of viable reversion mutations -->
<!-- To further understand the determinants of the number of viable reversion mutations, we explored the identity of the mutations that caused reversion from multicellularity to unicellularity at the transition and final time points of our experiment. For each time point we recorded the following: the identity of the mutant operation that caused reversion, the identity of the wild-type operation that was replaced, and the position in the genome. Figure \@ref(fig:case-study-reversion-mutation-identities) gives a representative example reversion mutation network for our case study lineage at the final time point which highlights 3 major categories of mutation that lead to a reversion to unicellularity. First, the $<h\_divide\_remote>$ operation, which encodes propagule production, can be inserted at several sites in the genome (usually upstream of the operation encoding tissue accretion) to repress tissue accretion in a dominant epistatic manner. Second, the regulatory loci controlling the expression of tissue accretion can be disrupted (e.g., the loss of the $<if\_res\_less\_than\_thresh>$ operation at position 12 in our final case study genome). Third, loss-of-function mutations occur when the tissue accretion operation, $<h\_divide\_local>$, is substituted for another operation that does not disrupt propagule production.   -->
<!-- When we look at the spectrum of reversion mutations across all 65 lineages that evolved multicellularity, we find that the same basic pattern emerges at both the transition and final time points (Figs. \@ref(fig:reversion-mutation-identities)-\@ref(fig:wt-operation-identities)). Loss-of-function mutations are the most common cause of reversion followed closely by dominant epistatic mutations. Changes in regulatory elements make up the third most common category of reversion mutation and occur at a slightly higher frequency in the final genomes than the transition genomes. The biggest difference in mutation spectrum between the transition and final time points is in the frequency at which $<nop\_x>$ operations are replaced (Fig. \@ref(fig:wt-operation-identities)). However, this difference is caused by the fact that the ancestral unicell that was used to initiate each evolutionary run had an extremely minimal genome composed largely of  $<nop\_x>$ operations (a null operation). These large blocks of null operations are gradually replaced over time as the population evolves; thus, earlier time points will contain more null operations than later ones. When adjusted for the frequency of the $<nop\_x>$ operation in the multicell genomes ($24.4\%$ at the time of transition vs. $1.9\%$ at the final time point), the difference in frequency effectively goes to zero. -->
<!-- Another factor we hypothesized could lead to a decrease in the number of viable reversion mutations was the presence of redundant tissue accretion mutations. Since the primary routes to achieving unicellularity involve replacing or silencing the expression of the tissue accretion instruction, it is possible that multicells could become more robust to reversion by accumulating secondary functional copies of the $<h\_divide\_local>$ operation. We found some evidence of a trend in this direction (Fig. \@ref(fig:redundant-tissue-accretion-instructions)). -->
<!-- \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Note to Heather: Please help!} Four genotypes (4310T, 3038F, 4278F, and 4310F) had a total of 147 reversion mutations that did not map to any existing position in their consensus genomes. These errors make up ~1.16\% of the total number of reversion mutations in our study.} -->
